# Data Link

## Devices

### Bridge

Bridges sit between hub-connected hosts, and they only have two ports. They also learn which hosts are on each site, so they contain data in each side, without leakage - a problem observed with hubs:

### Switch

Switches could be called a combination of hubs and bridges. Like hubs, they can accept many devices, and like bridges, they learn which hosts are on each port. They facilitate communication **within** a network. A switch uses MAC addresses to forward data at the data link layer.

### Router

Routers facilitate communication **between** networks - the main difference vs. switches. They provide a traffic control point, i.e. security, filtering, redirecting.  
Routers learn which networks they are attached to. The knowledge of each of these networks, are called **routes**. They're stored in the router's routing table - all networks it knows about. The knowledge is actually represented as IP addresses in each network the router is attached to:

In the example above, the router is attached to networks `172.16.20.x` & `172.16.30.x`. As the priors interface, it is given the IP address `172.16.20.1`. For the network `172.16.30.x`, it's given `172.16.30.254`. These IP addresses are called **gateways** - each host's way out of their local network.  
For example, if host `.33` wants to send data to the other network, it knows it has to go through a router. The IP address of that router is stored as that host's default gateway. In this case - `.1`

### Other Than Switches & Routers

There are many other network devices:
- Access points
- [[osi/index#Firewall|Firewalls]]
- [[osi/index#Load Balancer|Load balancers]]
- Virtual switches
- Layer 3 switches
- IDS/IPS
- [[osi/index#Proxy Server|Proxies]]
- Virtual Routers

But all of them perform routing and/or switching.

## Afterthoughts

### Routers vs. Switches

Routing is the process of moving data **between** networks. A router is a device whose primary purpose is routing.

Switching is the process of moving data **within** networks. A switch is a device whose primary purpose is switching.
