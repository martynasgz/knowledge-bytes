# 1. Physical

Physical layer's goal is to transport bits between hosts. It works with the actual physical signal, without trying to interpret the data behind it.

## Devices / Technology

### Cables

Cables such Ethernet, Coaxial & Fiber.

### Modem

Word modem is derived from a contraction of modulator/demodulator. It takes a digital signal coming from a digital node and converts it to an analog signal (modulates) to be placed on the wire. In return, it accepts an analog signal from the wire and converts it to a digital one (demodulates) so the node understands it.

### Repeater

Repeaters regenerate signals, so that data doesn't decay as it travels. They allow communication between greater distances.

### Hub

Since connecting each host to each other is not scalable, we need a device that would sit in the center of the network, and each host would be connected to it. That way, when a new host gets added, we only need to make one new connection.

Hub fixes that problem - it is a multi-port repeater. It takes a signal and replicates it to all the others ports. But there's a disadvantage - everyone receives everyone else's data.  
In the example below, host 1 wants to communicate with host 2, so it sends data to the hub. But the data gets repeated to everyone:
