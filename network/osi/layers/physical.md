### Modem

Word modem is derived from a contraction of modulator/demodulator. It takes a digital signal coming from a digital node and converts it to an analog signal (modulates) to be placed on the wire. In return, it accepts an analog signal from the wire and converts it to a digital one (demodulates) so the node understands it.

### Hub

Just like a modem, doesn't care where the signal comes from or goes to. It takes a signal and replicates it to all the others. Not really common in modern networking.
