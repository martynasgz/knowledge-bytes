### Multilayer Switch (MLS)

Provides normal [[data-link| layer 2]] network switching services, but also allows layer 3 or higher OSI model services. The most common MLS is a layer 3 switch. It not only utilizes an ASIC chip for switching, but it also routes. This allows passing data to non-local network devices.

### Router

Most common network device to connect different networks together utilizing the network layer. Instead of an ASIC chip which switches use, they use software to keep track of different networks and what it considers to be the best possible route to reach those networks. It can communicate with both local & non-local devices.
