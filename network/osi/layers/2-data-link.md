# Data Link

This layer actually interacts with the physical layer - it puts bits on & retrieves them from the wire. The NIC (Network Interface Card) or Wi-Fi access card the wire is connected to on a computer is considered layer 2. Layer 2 exists to move data from one host to another - *hop-to-hop* communication.

It uses a MAC addressing scheme:
- 48 bits, represented as 12 hex digits, e.g. `94:65:9C:3B:8A:E5`.
- Every NIC has a unique MAC address. These addresses allow data to go from one NIC to another.

[[#Switch|Switches]] help accomplish hops between a (internal) network of devices, but, often, communication between hosts require multiple hops over networks. That means jumping across multiple routers to get to the target host. Each of those routers are connected to a wire using a NIC. And each of them have a MAC address. Layer 2 helps accomplish exactly that - takes data from the first MAC address & delivers it to the next one:

All in all, layer 2 takes care of every *hop*. But what takes care of ensuring data goes from one endpoint to the next? The [[3-network|network layer]]

## Devices

### Bridge

Bridges sit between hub-connected hosts, and they only have two ports. They also learn which hosts are on each site, so they contain data in each side, without leakage - a problem observed with hubs:

### Switch

Switches could be called a combination of hubs and bridges. Like hubs, they can accept many devices, and like bridges, they learn which hosts are on each port. They facilitate communication **within** a network. A switch uses MAC addresses to forward data at the data link layer:

## Afterthoughts

### Switches vs. Routers

Switching is the process of moving data **within** networks. A switch is a device whose primary purpose is switching.

Routing is the process of moving data **between** networks. A router is a device whose primary purpose is routing.
