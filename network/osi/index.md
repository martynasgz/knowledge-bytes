# Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model

## Devices

### Layer Specific

- [[physical#Devices|Physical]]
- [[data-link#Devices|Data Link]]
- [[network#Devices|Network]]

### Agnostic

#### Firewall

A firewall can be placed on routers, hosts, or can be its own device. It is the first line of defense in protecting the internal network from outside threats. It functions specifically in layers 2, 3, 4 & 7.  
It blocks packets from entering or leaving the network via:
- Stateless inspection: checks & enforces every packet against pre-defined rules.
- Stateful inspection: examines connection state.

#### VPN Concentrator

A device that connects many remote networks and clients to a central corporate network. Concentrators can function at multiple layers of the OSI model - layer 2, 3 & 7. Similarly to a [[vpn/index|VPN]], it encrypts outgoing and incoming data and uses security protocols to create safe tunnels, but on a larger scale. It is widely used by large companies with many remote employees.
