# Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model

## Terms

Host - any device which sends or receives traffic. Hosts are identified by their **IP address**.

Network - logical grouping of hosts which require similar connectivity. Networks can contain other networks, called subnets:

Hosts on the network share the same space IP address space:

The reason one might separate sets of networks is because they need different connectivity requirements. But, in the end, if one wants those networks to communicate between each other, they'll need a [[3-network#Router|router]].

## Devices

### Layer Specific

- [[1-physical#Devices / Technology|Physical]]
- [[2-data-link#Devices|Data Link]]
- [[3-network#Devices|Network]]

### Those Considered as Switches & Routers

There are many other network devices:
- Access points
- [[#Firewall|Firewalls]]
- [[#Load Balancer|Load balancers]]
- Virtual switches
- Layer 3 switches
- IDS/IPS
- [[#Proxy Server|Proxies]]
- Virtual Routers

But all of them perform routing and/or switching.

#### Firewall

A firewall can be placed on routers, hosts, or can be its own device. It is the first line of defense in protecting the internal network from outside threats. It functions specifically in layers 2, 3, 4 & 7.  
It blocks packets from entering or leaving the network via:
- Stateless inspection: checks & enforces every packet against pre-defined rules.
- Stateful inspection: examines connection state.

#### VPN Concentrator

A device that connects many remote networks and clients to a central corporate network. Concentrators can function at multiple layers of the OSI model - layer 2, 3 & 7. Similarly to a [[vpn/index|VPN]], it encrypts outgoing and incoming data and uses security protocols to create safe tunnels, but on a larger scale. It is widely used by large companies with many remote employees.

#### Load Balancer

Distributes requests (workload) among different server instances, in a way that no single one gets overloaded.

#### Proxy Server

Appliance that requests resources on behalf of client machines - it hides and protects it, can filter content, and increase network performance via caching.
